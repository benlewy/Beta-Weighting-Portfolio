# Beta-Weighting-Portfolio
Computes the beta-weights of a selected portfolio and returns the delta and delta of 1% moves in the benchmark

So, when you beta weight your portfolio, it standardizes the risk levels of individual positions by converting the delta of each position relative to a comparable index or benchmark. In this case the benchmark used is the S&P 500.

This makes it possible to do an “apples-to-apples” comparison of all your positions. Beta weighting could help traders assess the various positions in terms of a portfolio’s systemic risk, which is the risk borne by the market as a whole.

The user can input the starting date, the tickers in the portfolio, as well as the weights.
